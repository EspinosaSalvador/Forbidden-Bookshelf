## Description

USER STORY

As a book lover and avid reader
I WANT to manage my personal book collection,
I WANT to create a personal account with a unique login so that I can securely access my bookshelf from any device,
SO THAT I can search for books and add them to my bookshelf with ease.
Finally, I want to be able to back-up my bookshelf data on a server, so that I never lose my book collection even if I switch devices.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
